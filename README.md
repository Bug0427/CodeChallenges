# Coding Challenges Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of 20+ progressively challenging coding problems designed to demonstrate practical software engineering skills across multiple languages, paradigms, and problem domains.

Unlike typical algorithm-only practice, these challenges emphasize real-world engineering concerns such as performance, correctness, concurrency, systems behavior, security, and data integrity.

Each challenge is implemented as a self-contained project with clear problem constraints and production-style structure.

### 📁 Repository Structure

#### Each folder (Challenge1, Challenge2, …) represents a single standalone challenge, typically containing:
	•	Source code files (language-specific)
	•	A challenge-specific README.md describing the problem
	•	Clear constraints and expectations
	•	Clean separation of logic and entry points

#### Languages and technologies used include:
	•	C++ (performance, data structures, concurrency)
	•	C (systems programming, memory safety, low-level control)
	•	Python (algorithms, concurrency, simulation)
	•	JavaScript / Node.js (backend systems, async logic)
	•	Bash / Unix tools (process control, log analysis, automation)
	•	Assembly (x86-64) (low-level fundamentals)

⸻

### 🎯 Goals of This Repository
	•	Demonstrate ability to solve non-trivial problems independently
	•	Show comfort working across abstraction levels, from assembly to backend logic
	•	Practice clean, readable, well-structured code
	•	Reflect skills relevant to real engineering roles, not just interview puzzles
	•	Build a portfolio that communicates range, depth, and technical maturity

⸻

### 🧠 Challenge Design Philosophy

#### The challenges intentionally cover:
	•	Algorithms and data structures
	•	Systems programming and OS interaction
	•	Concurrency and synchronization
	•	Databases (SQL / SQLite)
	•	Cryptography and authentication concepts
	•	Networking and backend infrastructure
	•	Numerical simulation and physics-based modeling

Problems are chosen to be interesting, practical, and representative of real engineering tasks rather than repetitive or contrived exercises.

### 🧪 How to Use This Repository
	•	Each challenge can be reviewed independently
	•	No external frameworks are assumed unless explicitly stated
	•	Solutions prioritize correctness, clarity, and efficiency
	•	Challenges are designed to scale in difficulty and scope

⸻

### 📌 Notes
	•	This repository focuses on implementation, not just theory
	•	Code is written as if it were intended to be maintained or reviewed
	•	Tradeoffs and edge cases are handled deliberately
